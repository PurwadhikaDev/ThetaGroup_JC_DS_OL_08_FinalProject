## Final Project


This is the final project for the Purwadhika Job Job Connector Data Science Online Class.

### Overview

Olist is a company that focuses on selling items online for merchants. They help remove the obstacles of many merchants that do not sell online by simplifying the online selling process and help them market the products of these merchants on major e-commerce marketplaces.

Olist has two types of customers, one is the buyers that purchases products listed by Olist on major marketplaces but the other, their true customers, are the businesses that they represent and help sell products online. To avoid confusion, we’ll refer to the customers that buy the products as end-customers and Olist’s main customers as merchants.

The only way for Olist to succeed is to by first having their customer’s succeed because, through the contract between the vendors and Olist, Olist charges a fee for every merchant item they’ve successfully sold. In other words, if the merchants are successful, Olist in turn is also successful.

After seeing the business model and the main focus of Olist, we’ve decided to use one of Olist’s most basic but most important aspect of any business, demand.

Demand and supply is a [fundamental](https://https://www.sumup.com/en-gb/invoices/dictionary/supply-and-demand/) concept in a market and the ability to understand demand and even know the demand in the future could help decide important decision that could directly impact both profit and efficiency for both Olist and its customers. 

Because Olist represents merchants in various online platforms and they have explicitly stated on their website that their mission is to "empower digital retail and provide real growth opportunities for small, medium, and large businesses", they can better deliver their services to their customers through the following:

* By being able to know when product demands are high, merchants could accurately decide how many products to stock. 
* Through accurate stocking, businesses could minimize risks and expenses of overstocking and understocking, such as loss caused by product expiration and loss of potential revenue caused by items out of stock.
* Being able to know the demand gives the merchants better insight on when to stock more on products which better ensures demand fulfillment and ultimately translates to optimized revenue.
* Overall, by being able to capture the demand conditions in the future and providing said information to the merchants, Olist help their merchants to grow even further. 

For Olist itself there are many benefits in being able to know the demand:

-	Olist as a business holds many positions, not only does it represent the merchants in the e-commerce marketplace, it also represents itself as a brand. Being able to know the demand means Olist has a better chance in minimizing risk of negative experiences caused by items not in stock due to low supply.
-	The increased revenue of Olist’s merchant translates directly to the increase of their revenue as well. 
-	Through providing key and useful information to their clientele, they can encourage growth of their merchants which in turn could inspire other merchants to join Olist and thus growing Olist as a business.
-	Most importantly, it creates credibility towards Olist as a brand in the eyes of all of its stakeholders because through this Olist proves that they remain true to their goal, to help businesses grow. 
 
In this notebook, we will try address those issues and offer a solution.
